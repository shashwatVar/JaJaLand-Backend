## About

JaJa-Land is a platform to rate the humorous side of people. It is a Web-App based on the concept of rating the joke and choice of people through a multiplayer game! In the game, at a time a group of 5-10 people will enter and each user will get the chance to present something funny through different rounds, everytime the user presents something the other users will rate his/her presentation and ultimately after all rounds the user with highest point, wins!!

## Background
The basic idea of the application is to integrate all the general ways by which a user can interact by the means of a Web application. The different projects undertaken by the organization will attempt to fulfill this ambition.

## Composition
The plan is to create rooms in which users enter for each game. Each game will comprise of rounds, for ex - a round in which user writes something and the other users rate his writing. Each user gets the opportunity to write/upload as per the round specifications. Each round will also contain a time flag which will auto-submit if time runs out. Every user must be registered to play the game.

## Prerequisites

* Basic ideas of Web-Development.
* Basic idea of Javascript or Typescript (Preferable).

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.
